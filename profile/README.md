## Hi there 👋

TGS is where data & insights intersect.

Across the energy spectrum, we bring together our vast subsurface data library combined with core
skills in geoscience, data processing, data management, data analytics and AI. For today and tomorrow,
traditional, and transformational, we have the energy data that uncover
insights and drive progress.
